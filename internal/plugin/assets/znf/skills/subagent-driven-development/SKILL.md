# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching a fresh implementer subagent per task, a task review (spec compliance + code quality) after each, and a broad whole-branch review at the end — run here when standalone, by `/ship` when under `/cook`.

> Why: see `references/setup-rationale.md` — why fresh subagents.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + task review (spec + quality) + broad final review = high quality, fast iteration

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the
ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner between tasks. Execute all tasks from the plan without stopping. The only reasons to stop are the four named below, or all tasks complete. "Should I continue?" prompts and progress summaries waste their time — they asked you to execute the plan, so execute it.

**Rulings, not stalls.** A running plan does not wait on a human. Conflicts,
ambiguities, plan defects, a cap you would have asked to exceed — decide
them. The spec is the binding authority, the plan is its argument, and your
judgment settles what neither answers. Record every decision in the ledger as
`Ruling: <what you decided> — <why> — <what it costs if wrong>`, and keep
going.

Four things stop you, and only these: an irreversible or destructive
operation; a security-sensitive action; a side effect outside this worktree
that norms say you ask about first (a merge, a push to a shared branch, a
publish); and a plan so broken that every path forward is a guess. For those,
stop and ask.

## The Process

> Diagram: see `references/diagrams.md`.

## Setup

> Why: see `references/setup-rationale.md` — losing your place.

Ensure the work happens in an isolated workspace: use
`wt new` (znf:discipline §8) to create one or verify the existing one.
Never start implementation on a main/master branch without your human
partner's explicit consent.

Track progress in a ledger file, not only in todos.

- Each plan owns a workspace: at skill start, run this skill's
  `scripts/sdd-workspace PLAN_FILE` — it prints the plan's git-ignored
  directory (`<repo-root>/.znf/sdd/<plan-basename>/`), home to
  every artifact for THIS plan: ledger, briefs, reports, review packages.
  Another plan's directory is never yours to read or write.
- Check for this plan's ledger at `<workspace>/progress.md`. If its first
  line names your plan file, tasks with a `Task <N>: complete` line are DONE
  — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first task without one. A task
  whose last line is a fix round is mid-loop: resume the loop at the next
  round. A ledger whose first line names a different plan file — or a stray
  ledger at the old flat path `.znf/sdd/progress.md` — is another
  plan's progress: leave it in place and start your own, fresh.
- Create the ledger with its identity as the first line:
  `# SDD ledger — plan: <plan file path>`.

Read the plan once, note its context and Global Constraints, and create a
todo per task. If the plan names a Spec, read that too: the spec is the
authority the plan argues from, and conflicts inside the plan resolve
against it. A plan with no reachable spec gets a ledger note saying so.

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts, writing down
what you checked as you check it:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

The scan's output is a table, not a verdict. Write the table to the ledger.
Rule on everything you find before execution begins — each finding against
the plan text that mandates it — and record each ruling in the ledger. If
the scan is clean, proceed without comment. Rule on each conflict it
surfaces — the spec is the binding authority, the plan is its argument —
record the ruling beside its row, and dispatch Task 1.

## Model Selection

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role to conserve cost and increase speed.

**Mechanical implementation tasks** (isolated functions, clear specs, 1-2 files): use a fast, cheap model. Most implementation tasks are mechanical when the plan is well-specified.

**Integration and judgment tasks** (multi-file coordination, pattern matching, debugging): use a standard model.

**Architecture and design tasks**: use the most capable available model.
The standalone final whole-branch review is one of these.

**Review tasks**: choose the model with the same judgment, scaled to the
diff's size, complexity, and risk. A small mechanical diff does not need the
most capable model; a subtle concurrency change does. Scoped re-reviews of
small fix diffs take a cheap-to-mid tier.

**Fix-loop escalation (rounds 4-5)**: use a model at least one tier above
the implementer that got stuck.

**Name the model on every dispatch.** `zenify up` sets
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=sonnet`, so a dispatch without `model` runs on
sonnet — right for mechanical work, wrong for design judgment. Pass `'opus'`
there and `'haiku'` for transcription; naming it keeps the intent visible.

**Turn count beats token price.** Wall-clock and context cost scale with how
many turns a subagent takes, and the cheapest models routinely take 2-3× the
turns on multi-step work — costing more overall. Use a mid-tier model as the
floor for reviewers and for implementers working from prose descriptions.
When the task's plan text contains the complete code to write, the
implementation is transcription plus testing: use the cheapest tier for
that implementer. Single-file mechanical fixes also take the cheapest tier.

**Task complexity signals (implementation tasks):**
- Touches 1-2 files with a complete spec → cheap model
- Touches multiple files with integration concerns → standard model
- Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding → most capable model

## The Task Loop

> Why: see `references/dispatch-and-review-rationale.md` — rationale for §1–§5, final review and finish.

**Batch small same-shape work.** When the plan lists several tasks that are
each a small, independent edit of the same kind — the same one-line fix,
constant change, or field addition repeated across files — do not dispatch
one subagent per task. Compose ONE dispatch brief listing every file and
its change, send the whole batch to a single subagent, and review its diff
as one unit. Reserve one-dispatch-per-task for work that needs its own
judgment, its own tests, or its own review surface.

**Cross-worktree parallelism (polyrepo).** A feature that spans repos runs as several
worktrees, one per repo (same slug) — the conflict rule above is about writers in the SAME
worktree; across repos, each has its own git working directory and index, so two implementers
writing into two repos cannot collide. Run them in parallel.

- Read the plan's per-repo `Repo:` / `Waits for:` block (writing-plans authors it). Dispatch
  **one implementer per repo**, concurrently for every repo whose dependency edges are all
  satisfied. A repo with no `Waits for:` line is independent — start it immediately.
- **Gate on contract-freeze, not on the whole repo.** A repo whose block says
  `Waits for: <X> : contract-frozen` starts as soon as X commits the endpoint + shape (a
  specific commit you record), NOT after X's whole plan finishes.
- **One ledger, repo-tagged.** Keep the single plan ledger; tag each task line with its repo
  (`[be] Task 3: complete`). Each repo's review loop runs on its own stream.
- **Collect each stream by name** — you must collect each repo-stream's report and treat
  silence as incomplete, never as clean (CLAUDE.md §3). Keep one TodoWrite line per repo-stream.
  A stream that went quiet is NOT done.
- **Within one repo, tasks stay sequential** — the rule above is unchanged; only the
  across-repo case is the exception.

Hand artifacts over as files.

**Waiting on dispatched subagents:** keep doing local work (ledger, next
package) while results arrive; when idle, wait in bounded stretches, then
list live children and chase any that finished without reporting.

### 1. Dispatch the implementer

Record BASE (`git rev-parse HEAD`) before dispatching — the review package
and fix-round diffs need it.

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, run this skill's
  `scripts/task-brief PLAN_FILE N` — it extracts the task's full text to a
  uniquely named file and prints the path. Compose the dispatch so the
  brief stays the single source of
  requirements. Your dispatch should contain: (1) one line on where this
  task fits in the project; (2) the brief path, introduced as "read this
  first — it is your requirements, with the exact values to use verbatim";
  (3) interfaces and decisions from earlier tasks that the brief cannot
  know; (4) your resolution of any ambiguity you noticed in the brief;
  (5) the report-file path and report contract. Exact values (numbers,
  magic strings, signatures, test cases) appear only in the brief. Never
  make a subagent read the whole plan file.
- **Report file:** name the implementer's report file after the brief
  (brief `…/task-N-brief.md` → report `…/task-N-report.md`) and put it in
  the dispatch prompt. The implementer writes the full report there and
  returns only status, commits, a one-line test summary, and concerns.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not
  paste accumulated prior-task summaries ("state after Tasks 1-3") into
  later dispatches. A fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it
  touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- The dispatch carries the no-subagents contract (it is in the
  implementer template): the implementer never dispatches subagents —
  not helpers, and never a reviewer. Review arrives from you, after the
  report.
- If an earlier task parked a finding in the area this task touches, carry
  a pointer to that ledger entry in the dispatch.
- Record the implementer's agent identity from the dispatch result —
  fix-loop rounds 1-3 resume this agent.
- Never dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel **into the same worktree** (conflicts). Across repos, each with its own worktree, see "Cross-worktree parallelism (polyrepo)" below.

Template: [implementer-prompt.md](implementer-prompt.md)

### 2. Handle the report

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Generate the review package (`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD`, from this skill's directory — never `HEAD~1`), then dispatch the task reviewer with the printed path.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** Read the concerns before proceeding.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, rule on the correction, ledger it, and re-dispatch with the ruling carried in the dispatch

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes.

### 3. Review the task

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. Never skip the task review, and never accept a
report missing either verdict — spec compliance AND task quality are both
required. Implementer self-review never replaces the task review; both are
needed.

- Hand the reviewer its diff as a file: run this skill's
  `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD` and pass the reviewer the file path
  it prints (or, without bash: `git log --oneline`, `git diff --stat`,
  and `git diff -U10` for the range, redirected to one uniquely named
  file). Use the BASE you recorded before dispatching the implementer —
  never `HEAD~1`, which silently truncates multi-commit tasks. Never
  dispatch a task reviewer without a diff file.
- **Reviewer inputs:** the task reviewer gets three paths — the same brief
  file, the report file, and the review package — plus the global
  constraints that bind the task.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention
  lens. Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global
  Constraints section or the spec: exact values, exact formats, and the
  stated relationships between components ("same layout as X", "matches
  Y").
- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" or "run race tests
  if useful" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the
  same code — the implementer's report carries the test evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to
  ignore or not flag a specific issue.

The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements
that live in unchanged code or span tasks. These do not block the rest of the
review, but you must resolve each one yourself before marking the task
complete: you hold the plan and cross-task context the reviewer
lacks. If you confirm an item is a real gap, treat it as a failed spec
review — it enters the fix loop with the other findings.

Template: [task-reviewer-prompt.md](task-reviewer-prompt.md)

### 4. The fix loop

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`); the whole-branch review
  (Final Review standalone, `/ship`'s `## Deferred` under `/cook`) triages
  which must be fixed before merge. Minor findings never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with
  what the plan's text requires — is yours to rule on: weigh the finding
  against the plan text, decide with the spec as the binding authority, and
  ledger the ruling before you act on it. Do not dismiss the finding because
  the plan mandates it, and do not dispatch a fix that contradicts the plan
  without a recorded ruling.
Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task:

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer.** Send it the open findings
verbatim. If your harness cannot send another message to a live subagent,
dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the brief path, the report-file path,
and the findings.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer on a more capable model** (per
Model Selection), with the brief path, the report-file path, the open
findings, and this framing: "A prior implementer attempted this task
[N] times; you own it now. Read the report file for what was tried."

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests
covering the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file,
and returns the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm
the fix report contains the covering tests, the command run, and the
output; dispatch the re-review once all three are present. Name the
covering test files in the fix message.

**The re-review is scoped.** Run `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD`
where FIX_BASE is the head the previous review saw, and dispatch
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md) with the findings list, the
brief, the report file, and the printed diff path. The re-reviewer verdicts
each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the fix
diff only. New Critical/Important breakage in the fix diff joins the open
findings list. Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred
minors — they never extend the loop.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session.

**The breaker.** When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop
dispatching. Adjudicate each open finding yourself.

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — Ruling: <why the code stands>`.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with
  a ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a
  plan defect: rule on the smallest change that unblocks the dependent work,
  ledger it as `Task <N>: Ruling: <finding> — <what you decided and why>`,
  and carry it into the next task's dispatch.

Every adjudication is a ledger entry — a silent discard is forbidden.

### 5. Complete the task

When the review comes back clean — or every open finding is parked with a
ruling at the cap — append the completion line to the ledger in the same
message as your other bookkeeping:

- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`
- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, <K> parked)` after a
  tripped breaker

Then mark the todo complete and move on. Never move to the next task while
the review has open Critical/Important issues that are neither fixed nor
parked-with-ruling at the cap.

## Final Review

**Under `/cook`, skip this section and go to Finish.** `/ship` runs next; its
engine review reads the whole branch plus the ledger's `minor (deferred)` and
`parked` lines through the ship-pack `## Deferred`. A second whole-branch pass
here would read the same diff twice. Standalone (no `/cook`), run it:

The final whole-branch review gets a package too: run
`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD` (MERGE_BASE = the commit the
branch started from, e.g. `git merge-base main HEAD`) and include the
printed path in the final review dispatch, so the final reviewer reads
one file instead of re-deriving the branch diff with git commands. Dispatch
on the most capable available model (see Model Selection), using this skill's
[code-reviewer-template.md](code-reviewer-template.md). Point it at
the ledger's deferred-minor and parked lines so it can triage which must be
fixed before merge.

If the final whole-branch review returns findings, dispatch ONE fix subagent
with the complete findings list — not one fixer per finding.

Then run exactly one scoped re-review of the fix wave
(`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD` over the fix range,
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md)).
Adjudicate any residual findings as in the task loop's breaker: park with
rulings, or rule on the load-bearing ones and ledger what you decided. Only
the four classes above stop you here. There is no second fix wave —
residual load-bearing findings surface to your human partner when
finishing-a-development-branch presents the options.

## Finish

Before you delete anything, collect every ledger line containing `Ruling:` —
preflight rulings, parked findings, breaker adjudications, all of them — into
your final message under "Rulings I made", in the order you made them, each
with what it costs if wrong. The list is exhaustive: if the ledger holds a
ruling, the list holds it.

Standalone, when the final review is clean and its fixes are merged, delete
this plan's workspace (`rm -rf <workspace>`) — the git history is the record
now. **Under `/cook`, leave it**: `/ship` reads the ledger, and the directory
is git-ignored. Sibling directories belong to other plans; leave them alone.

Use znf:finishing-a-development-branch.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Close enough on spec compliance" | Reviewer found spec gaps = not done. Fix or hit the cap and adjudicate — those are the only exits. |
| "I'll fix it myself, dispatching is overhead" | Controller fixes pollute your context and skip review. Resume the implementer. |
| "One more round will converge" | Past the cap the failure is structural. Adjudicate and route. |
| "The reviewer will just find something new anyway" | Scoped re-reviews verify fixes; they cannot wander. New findings on untouched code go to the ledger, not the loop. |
| "This finding is obviously wrong, I'll drop it" | You adjudicate only at the cap, and every ruling is a ledger entry. Silent discards are forbidden. |
| "The fix was small, skip the re-review" | Unreviewed fixes are how regressions land. Every round ends with a scoped re-review. |
| "Ledger bookkeeping is overhead" | The ledger is what survives compaction. Controllers without one have re-dispatched entire completed task sequences. |
| "The implementer spawned its own reviewer — free extra assurance" | It's a duplicate seat reviewing the same diff; the task review is the gate. A worker-spawned reviewer is a defect to flag, not rigor. |
